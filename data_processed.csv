no,10,dasilva_sabrina,2019-09-05 16:16:56 UTC,"<p>Yes! GLAST is also known as excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT) 1, and GLT-1 is also known as EAAT-2. Both GLAST and GLT-1 are known as astrocytic glutamate transporters, and both bring Glu into the astrocyte in a concentration-dependent manner with the same ions (3Na&#43; in, 1 H&#43; in, 1 K&#43; out). There are slight differences. For example, the lab used the pharmacological blocker, TBOA,¬†to block Glu transport. This molecule has slightly different IC50 values for¬†GLT-1 (17 nM) and GLAST (22 nM), but it is a potent inhibitor for both transporters nonetheless. Lower IC50 values = more potent inhibition.¬†</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Perhaps the most notable difference is that in astrocytes, GLAST is the predominant glutamate transporter during brain development. In mature organisms, GLT-1 becomes the most abundant transporter. In adult tissues, GLT-1 is responsible for up to 90% of the total glutamate clearance (Tanaka et al., 1997). GLAST still provides about 10% of the total¬†glutamate¬†clearance in adult tissues, so our research efforts target both GLT-1 and GLAST.¬†</p>

We think that these rapid changes may be occurring to help astrocytes and their mitochondria to protect the brain for a period of time, in that potentially-salvageable (penumbra) region.¬†</p>","Good question!¬†
 
 By neuroprotection, I am referring to any¬†way¬†that astrocytic mitochondria or astrocytes may be protecting the brain in some way. We think that there are changes that occur in the potentially salvageable area of the stroke site to help delay permanent damage following stroke. We know that astrocytes and astrocytic undergo many rapid changes (i.e., in morphology, reactivity, metabolism, etc.) following stroke. We think that some of these changes may¬†be potentially neuroprotective -- in other words, these changes may be protecting the brain following stroke, perhaps by replenishing some of the things that stroke damages immediately.¬†
 
 In essence, determining¬†how Glu transport evokes the rapid changes in astrocytic mitochondria will help us determine the mechanism behind how¬†or¬†why mitochondria fragment and decrease in number.¬†
 
 Mitochondrial fragmentation is an interesting topic because punctate mitochondria (the spherical shape mitochondria adopt when they fragment)¬†can be associated with either mitophagy or with increased ATP production (see: attached figure). Mitophagy could be a mechanism to rid damaged mitochondria. Increased ATP production could be a way to temporarily provide ATP to the astrocyte in times of metabolic stress (lack of blood flow = lack of oxygen and glucose).¬†Removing damaged mitochondria¬†or¬†increasing ATP production could both provide neuroprotection, perhaps in the potentially-salvageable penumbra.¬†
 
 
 
 Another potential neuroprotective mechanism would be the hypothesis that astrocytes undergo proliferation¬†because they may be de-differentiating then re-differentiating into neurons to help supplement the neuronal population, since neurons will die very quickly after stroke, whereas astrocytes are resilient for a period of time.¬†
 
 Also, just the fact that astrocytes remain alive for a period of time after stroke shows that they have some sort of resiliency. In this research, we are hoping to determine what processes make them resilient and how exactly these processes make them resilient.

One side project I'm working on is about how different subsets might depend on different respiratory complex (eg. pyruvate and complex I fuels proliferation, while succinate and complex II+III fuels effector functions). A previous project in our lab looked at the dependence of different subsets on lipid metabolism. Both naive and effector memory T cells upregulate fatty acid oxidation following nutrient challenge, but in naive T cells IFNy production is decreased, while effector memory T cells are able to maintain their IFNy production.¬†",Memory T-cell subsets,started_off_s_answer,Irene Su,irenesu@sas.upenn.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 <p>By neuroprotection, I am referring to any¬†way¬†that astrocytic mitochondria or astrocytes may be protecting the brain in some way.

 <p>Mitochondrial fragmentation is an interesting topic because punctate mitochondria (the spherical shape mitochondria adopt when they fragment)¬†can be associated with either mitophagy or with increased ATP production (see: attached figure).

This would be interesting as a potential neuroprotective mechanism to replenish the neuron population, since neurons die right away following stroke, whereas astrocytes can remain alive for a period of time while undergoing rapid changes.¬†
 
 In examining lab data¬†and my preliminary data, we usually run¬†the slice culture experiments for no shorter than 24 hours. So¬†I'll put the slices in the oxygen-glucose deprivation apparatus for 30 minutes, then put the slices in oxygen and glucose-containing media for 24 or 48 hours. Proliferation was observed at the 48-hour time point so far, and the lab's previous data doesn't see¬†significant proliferation after 24 hours.
 
 Notably, when we look at changes in¬†mitochondrial morphologies in our mouse model, we use shorter time points: 1 hour, 3 hours, and 24 hours after stroke. We see mitochondrial fragmentation as early as 1 hour after stroke, but this is not necessarily related to astrocyte proliferation at all, and this is in a mouse model rather than the slice culture model that I'm currently using.¬†",mitochondria/proliferation,started_off_s_answer,Sabrina DaSilva,sdasilva@sas.upenn.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 <p>When designing CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNAs, it&#39;s incredibly important to consider the fact that Cas9 only makes a cut in the DNA. The insertions/deletions that result are due to non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), meaning that the indels could result in a 1 nucleotide shift, 2 nucleotide shift, or 3 nucleotide shift (in-frame mutation). In addition, some¬†target sequences require that both alleles are knocked out in order to be effective. The guide RNAs¬†of this library were¬†specifically designed to target functionally important domains, meaning that even in-frame mutation in just a single allele could greatly disrupt¬†protein function (see reference below). This generates a higher proportion of null mutations and greater severity of selection.

 When designing CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNAs, it's incredibly important to consider the fact that Cas9 only makes a cut in the DNA. The insertions/deletions that result are due to non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), meaning that the indels could result in a 1 nucleotide shift, 2 nucleotide shift, or 3 nucleotide shift (in-frame mutation). In addition, some¬†target sequences require that both alleles are knocked out in order to be effective. The guide RNAs¬†of this library were¬†specifically designed to target functionally important domains, meaning that even in-frame mutation in just a single allele could greatly disrupt¬†protein function (see reference below). This generates a higher proportion of null mutations and greater severity of selection. In addition,¬†online web tools are used to ensure that chosen sequences have minimal off-target effects (see¬†http://crispr.mit.edu/).¬†

 <p>I do think the genes are related, but I don&#39;t think that entry into dormancy is necessarily preparing the system for later proliferation. Rather, I think they are opposing processes.

 <p>There are many labs that study the epitopes that drive T-cell responses. However, the study of cryptic epitopes has been widely neglected - most people study immune responses to epitopes from canonical proteins. We want to better understand all sources of epitopes and make sure we are not neglecting this subset of cryptic epitopes in our studies of the immune system. Our preliminary data suggests that mice generate extremely strong responses to our cryptic epitope M-9 compared to the responses they generate against previously characterized canonical epitopes. Thus, neglecting cryptic epitopes means we are neglecting a large part of the immune response in our studies.¬†</p>
 <p>Furthermore, while we use a model of influenza to study cryptic epitopes and characterize the mechanisms of their generation, we believe the downstream clinical applications are most important for the treatment of autoimmunity and cancer. This is because cryptic epitopes could potentially serve as a new epitope that suddenly triggers the immune system to target self in autoimmunity. Another group previously showed that¬†a cryptic epitope from insulin can¬†drive T-cell responses in a model of type 1 diabetes in mice. Cryptic epitopes could also serve as a unique target for immunotherapies to treat cancer. If we understand how these cryptic epitopes are generated, we may better be able to modulate the immune response in these conditions.¬†</p>","Thanks for your question Talya.
 There are many labs that study the epitopes that drive T-cell responses. However, the study of cryptic epitopes has been widely neglected - most people study immune responses to epitopes from canonical proteins. We want to better understand all sources of epitopes and make sure we are not neglecting this subset of cryptic epitopes in our studies of the immune system. Our preliminary data suggests that mice generate extremely strong responses to our cryptic epitope M-9 compared to the responses they generate against previously characterized canonical epitopes. Thus, neglecting cryptic epitopes means we are neglecting a large part of the immune response in our studies.¬†
 Furthermore, while we use a model of influenza to study cryptic epitopes and characterize the mechanisms of their generation, we believe the downstream clinical applications are most important for the treatment of autoimmunity and cancer. This is because cryptic epitopes could potentially serve as a new epitope that suddenly triggers the immune system to target self in autoimmunity. Another group previously showed that¬†a cryptic epitope from insulin can¬†drive T-cell responses in a model of type 1 diabetes in mice. Cryptic epitopes could also serve as a unique target for immunotherapies to treat cancer. If we understand how these cryptic epitopes are generated, we may better be able to modulate the immune response in these conditions.¬†",cryptic epitopes,started_off_s_answer,Nikita Maheshwari,nikm@sas.upenn.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 <p>Yes, that is the idea! We are using influenza as a model to study what kinds of epitopes could be upregulated in cases of inflammation, like in cancer. Many other groups work on using immunopeptidomics to discover what kinds of epitopes are presented in human malignancies.

 Good question. As I discussed, there was a 2001 paper in Cell (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11595186) that showed that telomerase knock out mice with half long and short telomeres were phenotypically similar to their telomerase null parents with only short telomeres. Thus, we believe the distribution/population of telomeres within a cell doesn&#39;t matter as much in activating the DNA damage response and causing apoptosis as the few critically short ones. One critically short telomere is enough to induce pathogenesis. Previous telomere length measurements (like the aging correlation study I discussed) have looked at average telomere length in peripheral blood. We are looking at the shortest guys, which be believed are most important for disease.

 <p></p>
 <p>Since we are concerned about off target effects of our knockout, especially involving IRE1a since it is involved in a number of unstudied pathways, our guide RNA for CRISPR targets a sequence after the splice site of IRE1a on XBP1. Since the splice site occurs relatively early in the sequence for XBP1, we are still able to generate an XBP1 knockout. This means IRE1a will still recognize XBP1 mRNA, but the translation product will not be functional.¬†</p>

As far as I know she was generally successful at isolating the embryo at the right time-point but it did require frequent checking and careful planning.¬†",Morula extraction,started_off_s_answer,Asha Dahiya,dahiya@sas.upenn.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 <p>I think it the question of perfect replication vs patching over damage involves a variety of factors¬†such as depth of injury and location. For example, if the skin was injured in an area of the body that doesn&#39;t move, the skin will heal better than if the injury occurred in an area where the body does move and disturbs the skin during the healing process. If more layers of tissue are damaged, then the injury is more likely to scar. Age can also play a factor in how well the tissue heals.¬†</p>","Thanks for the question, Marc!

Our collaborators expressed Channelrhodopsin, an ion channel that opens in response to blue light, in class III neurons then exposed them to burst pulses of light after injury to trigger the firing of bursts.

 So we don&#39;t know yet how bursting actually leads to the axon being able to regrow. There&#39;s some work showing that different firing patterns trigger the activation of different transcriptional programs in neurons, so one possibility is that burst firing activates certain pro-regeneration genes in the class IV neuron that alter the cytoskeleton, increase trafficking and transport of material to the axon, and allow for regrowth. 
 
 Also, thalamocortical neurons in the thalamus, which gates sensory information to the rest of the brain, are also known to start burst firing during sleep. One idea is that the burst firing serves as a way for these neurons to ignore incoming stimuli, instead allowing for the neurons to do their own thing during sleep and carry out other functions. It&#39;s possible that the injured fly neurons start burst firing for a similar reason, turning off their sensory function and instead focusing on regeneration.","Much appreciated my man.

SBE5 exhibits more subtle control of Shh expression than SBE1, so I believe that is why SBE1 was examined first, instead. However, SBE5 regulation seems to be more significant within the zli (which is one of the sources of Shh, if you remember), while SBE1 regulation is more significant in the ventral midline (which is the other source of Shh).

However, there may be indirect defects outside of the thalamus that occur due to the interconnectedness of developmental processes, but these are yet to be parsed out and are most likely less significant than those seen in the thalamus. As of yet, single cell RNA sequencing data comparing wild type vs. enhancer knockout neuronal cells have illustrated important differences in RNA expression within the thalamic region, but not so much other ventral brain structures.

 <p>Yes, of course I can explain a bit more.

The RNA probe is transcribed in-vitro from a linearized plasmid containing the gene of interest, but is supplied with uracils that are tagged with a highly antigenic molecule. As such, the newly transcribed RNA probe is laced with antigen. After the RNA probe complementarily binds to wherever the RNA molecule of interest is found within a tissue sample, an antibody for the incorporated antigen is applied. The antibody binds to the antigen, which is bound to the RNA probe, which is bound to the RNA of interest. An alkaline phosphatase enzyme is attached to the antibody. Then, upon further application of a substrate (BM Purple) for the phosphatase enzyme, a reaction occurs in which color is formed. As such, color stains wherever the RNA of interest is found within a tissue.¬†</p>

 <p></p>
 <p>Thanks so much for your question! I apologize for the rushed nature of the end of my presentation, I did not spend a lot of time explaining my last aim and I completely understand you missing what I said.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>So the zli is one of the two sources within the neural tube that secrete Shh into the surrounding tissue to generate a signaling concentration gradient for predetermination of different regions within the central nervous system: as such, it is of great interest for our lab to understand how Shh expression within the zli is regulated spatially and temporally. It seems that SBE5 is significantly involved in zli formation, as its knockout results in a significant loss of zli length. My last aim specifically is based on the observations that, within the SBE5 single-knockout embryos, the difference in zli length changes over time. 12.5 days post-fertilization, the difference in zli length is much less significant than that seen at 10.5 days post-fertilization. As such, it seems that SBE5 knockout is more detrimental at earlier stages, and that Shh expression within the zli seems to be &#34;catching up&#34; as time goes on: in other words, SBE5 might be initiating the expression of Shh within the zli at a specific earlier stage, but it may not be responsible for maintaining Shh expression at later embryonic stages, thus the &#34;catch-up&#34; that we see. I hope to parse these details out by evaluating Shh expression within the zli at closely spaced, intermediate embryonic stages, and to see if SBE5 knockout has its greatest effects at a particular stage-- i.e. the temporal aspects of SBE5 regulation.¬†</p>

 <p>That&#39;s a good question! Establishing how phenotypes will be quantified is always a point of great importance/contention before carrying out the experiments. When the overall behavior of single mutant mice (in which only SBE1 or SBE5 is knocked out) is evaluated, they actually exhibit &#34;half-way&#34; phenotypes (i.e. less severe defects). I could not go into this as much due to time, but in order to properly quantify such behaviors we take note of a couple things. One factor includes severity of the phenotype: for example, when observing balancing ability, a mouse is scored on a scale of 1-4, with 1 representing an ability to smoothly walk along a narrow ledge, and 4 representing the times a mouse cannot even move along the ledge, and instead falls off. Another factor includes frequency of the phenotype: for example, when observing for an abnormal, splayed walking gait, a mouse is evaluated for a set amount of time and the number of occurrences in which the splayed gait is exhibited is recorded. There are other ways to control and ensure maximal quantitative objectivity, including recording measurements from multiple people, or carrying out a blind experiment in which the measurements are carried out by an individual who does not know the genotypes of the mice in the study.¬†</p>

Syntaphilin is important because while mitochondria can be very volatile, sometimes they need to be localized to one place that demands high energy and ATP production. For example, in neurons, syntaphilin localizes mitochondria to regions of the axon where Na-K ATPase pumps are working, because they need a lot of ATP in a very short time to restore sodium and potassium levels to equilibrium after the action potential. We suspect that in migration, syntaphilin also plays a role in directing and localizing mitochondria. I previously thought syntaphilin changes were related to calcium levels, stimulating greater migration, but after testing it I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the case - it is most likely related to the increase in metabolism in SNPH-KO cells, both glycolysis and oxphos.

 <p>Hi Ben,</p>
 <p>So intron inclusion is a permanent modification that occurs spontaneously. It is actually random and occurs fairly infrequently as it usually has catastrophic effects. <br />Generally ends up making for proteins which are usually nonfunctional as the included intron needs to be in the same reference frame as the remainder of the mRNA. Otherwise, a reading frame shift will occur and catastrophic effects will take place like premature stop codon etc. Thus, the only potential benefit is in new or improved gain of function &#34;mutations&#34; where the included intron somehow makes the enzyme superior to the native enzyme. This is extremely unlikely to occur though.</p>

I&#39;d estimate the upper limit at the moment, given fluorophore choices, is around 4/5 colors - that being said, if more suitable fluorophores are discovered, this technique should be further extendable, as specificity and binding time are solely determined by the binding kinetics of the complementary DNA.</p>","Good question - we've simulated 5-color experiments using well-characterized point spread functions that are spatially colocalized, and the technique worked well.

 <p>So there are a couple reasons why we use chloroplasts. First off, there are around 10,000 chloroplasts within a plant cell, making it so so efficient as far as producing copies of our protein of interest. Also, the chloroplast underwent endosymbiosis later than the mitochondria, so it isn&#39;t as highly adapted to the genome of whatever it&#39;s in (making it easier for us to work with and adapt). Furthermore, in plants at least, the chloroplast is truly the powerhouse of the cell and the mitochondria essentially gets its energy from the chloroplast, so we figured may as well go straight to the powerhouse. And finally, whereas our antibiotic (spectinomycin) is specific to chloroplast, there is no antibiotic as of yet that has been found to work for mitochondria without disrupting any other processes.¬†</p>","Hi!

 <p>For the sake of clarity, I omitted the fact that we actually inject AD-tau both into the hippocampus and into the cortex. This is because we would like to inject the full double volume into the hippocampus (because of its relevance to the disease locality) but the hippocampus can&#39;t hold so much exogenous protein at once. Instead, on the way up and out, we stop the needle in the overlying cortex and unload the other half of the volume of AD-tau there, which can slowly drip into the hippocampus due to gravity. However, some tends to stay in the cortex, and so we do tend to see pathology in the cortex even by 1 month post-injection. This doesn&#39;t seem to change the amount of cortical pathology that we eventually see from retrograde spreading to cortical regions as compared to a hippocampus-only injection scheme.

 <p>The macroscopic cause of PD is the actual neurodegeneration (neuronal death) which causes the symptoms. However, from a biochemical standpoint, the hallmark of PD is the aggregation of synuclein. That said, the community is still not 100% satisfied with the notion that synuclein is the cause of PD because there have been some studies showing that the presence of synuclein pathology does not necessarily directly lead to neuronal loss. It&#39;s quite likely that there&#39;s some intermediary that might be bridging the gap between synuclein and death, but its identity is unclear at the moment.</p>","Thanks!

 <p>These frequencies correspond to a phenomenon in electroencephalography called &#34;burst-suppression.&#34; Burst-suppression corresponds to regions of the spectra that are high neuronal activity (bursts) followed by periods of low-to-no neuronal activity (suppression).

 <p>Very interesting question! Yes, let me give some slight background. The first anesthetic demonstrated in a clinical setting was diethyl ether in 1846 at Mass General. The majority of modern day anesthetics are just halogenated ethers (alterations to diethyl ether). The reason why modern day anesthetics are halogenated is because diethyl ether is very flammable especially when mixed with oxygen (exactly the conditions when you&#39;re giving inhalation anesthetic). Therefore, in an effort to mitigate any unwanted combustions, they noticed that halogenating the ether made it significantly less reactive and flammable. Therefore, these anesthetics are what have remained to this day!</p>","Thanks!

Further, the highest dose of DEX I give is 1 mg/kg and the dose of atipamezole I give to all the mice is 1 mg/kg, since atipamezole has higher binding affinities for the receptors than does DEX, I can be sure that DEX isn&#39;t out competing (at least the majority) of bound atipamezole.¬†</p>

 <p>Guanfacine is also an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist. Similarly to DEX, it binds most tightly to the A subtype of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. The difference, however, is the fact that Guanfacine generally binds to postsynaptic receptors, which actually works to increase neuronal firing (in the case of treating ADHD, it helps synaptic connectivity in the prefrontal cortex and enhance attention and memory consolidation).

 <p>There are some benefits-- DEX has the ability to not produce full hypnosis if desired. Therefore, it is called a &#34;semi-cooperative&#34; anesthetic. If given low enough doses, the patient is easily disturbed and cooperative. Interestingly enough, dexmedetomidine, before being recognized as an anesthetic in its own right, was used synergistically with other general anesthetics (such as halothane or isoflurane) to reduce the amount of general anesthetic necessary to produce unconsciousness. After the experiments in 1997 that I referenced in my presentation by Mervyn Maze&#39;s group at UCSF, DEX was brought to the clinic as an anesthetic and sedative by itself.¬†</p>","Thanks Sylvia!

 <p>Good questions!</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>If DEX is binding non-specifically at other receptors, like other subtypes of the alpha-2 adrenoceptor, this would mean that there isn&#39;t as much drug reaching its most potent target receptor, the A subtype. As a result, the sedative state actually attained might be less than the desired level of sedation¬†by the anesthesiologist in dosing.¬†</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Most likely, yes. The Locus Coeruleus houses the majority of adrenergic cell bodies found in the central nervous system. As a result, if DEX is binding outside of the LC, this means it is probably binding to non-adrenergic neurons. Adrenergic neurons in the central nervous system are most commonly associated with arousal. Therefore, if DEX binds to non-adrenergic neurons, this means the level of sedation produced will be less than the theoretical sedation if all of DEX was reaching alpha-2A receptors. Therefore, yes, this would mean that a patient would be more likely to experience anesthesia awareness if proper precautions are not taken.¬†</p>
